# CadreIQ Platform - Replit Development Guide

## Overview

CadreIQ Platform is an AI-powered sales management platform prototype built with Streamlit. The application provides role-based dashboards for CRO, Regional Director, and Sales Manager personas, featuring comprehensive sales analytics, strategic playbook management, AI coaching guidance, and performance tracking capabilities.

## System Architecture
